Bailey Cells as a Superproducer of Very-Long-Chain Saturated Fatty Acids: An Unusual Phenomenon in Plant Cell Lipid Metabolism</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Plant cell cultures are widely applied for producing various beneficial secondary metabolites, including the antitumor drug paclitaxel and the antimalarial drug ajmaline (Smetanska 2008). The cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures in bioreactors makes their commercial use feasible. After extracting the target substances, a significant amount of biomass remains. This biomass contains lipids that are typically not extracted during the isolation of polar secondary metabolites and proteins. The importance of lipids for human nutrition and health has been highlighted in numerous reviews. Moreover, the lipid composition of the diet is a critical factor (Calder et al., 2018; Khalili Tilami &amp; Kouřimská, 2022; Frydrych et al., 2025). Therefore, analyzing the lipid composition of plant cell cultures is essential for identifying lipids with beneficial nutraceutical, cosmetic, and pharmacological properties.</p>
<p>The lipid metabolism of plant cell cultures is not yet fully elucidated. The fatty acid (FA) composition of total lipids (TL) in cell cultures is generally established to be analogous to that of the intact plant. The main FAs of TL in these cultures are palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1Δ9), linoleic (18:2Δ9,12), and linolenic (18:3Δ9,12,15) acids (Tattrie and Veliky 1973; Meï et al. 2015). However, in addition to these common FAs, unusual fatty acids can also be present in cell cultures. For instance, Kim et al. (1996) reported that cell suspension cultures of <em>Coriandrum sativum</em> L. produce 0.25–0.46% (by weight of total FAs) of petroselinic acid (18:1Δ6). In 1972, Yano et al. obtained callus cell cultures of <em>Malva parviflora</em> L. and <em>M. sylvestris</em> L., which produced up to 20.0% of cyclopropyl and cyclopropenyl FAs, including dihydromalvalic and malvalic acids, respectively. Notably, these examples are limited to fatty acids with an 18-carbon chain, although FAs with longer chains exist.</p>
<p>Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are a class of fatty acids characterized by having more than 20 carbon atoms and serving as precursors for the biosynthesis of numerous metabolites (Haslam and Kunst 2013). Plant cells can contain a variety of saturated, as well as monoenoic, dienoic, and polyenoic unsaturated, very-long-chain fatty acids (Hitchcock and Nichols 1971). They are found in both neutral and polar lipids but are primarily utilized in wax and suberin synthesis, making them essential for protection against biotic and abiotic stress (Bach and Faure 2010; Batsale et al. 2021). As a general rule, VLCFAs do not accumulate in large quantities (typically &gt;1%) in plant cell cultures. For example, Nosov et al. (2023) reported VLCFA percentages of 2.7% and 4.7% for dark-grown and light-grown callus, respectively, and 2.0–2.4% for suspension cultures of <em>Sutherlandia frutescens</em> (L.) <a href="http://R.Br">R.Br</a>. In contrast, Titova et al. (2021) found that callus cell culture of <em>Alhagi persarum</em> Boiss. et Buhse contained less than 1% VLCFAs. Nevertheless, specific cultivation conditions have been shown to augment VLCFA levels. Nosov et al. (2024) demonstrated that suspension cultures of <em>Euonymus maximowiczianus</em> Prokh. cultivated in the absence of light synthesized up to 6% VLCFAs. In this case, the VLCFA fraction was predominantly composed of saturated FAs, including arachidic (20:0), behenic (22:0), tricosanoic (23:0), lignoceric (24:0), and pentacosanoic (25:0) acids.</p>
<p>VLCFAs also have industrial importance. For instance, behenic acid and its derivatives are employed in the production of cosmetics designed for skin hydration (Calder et al., 2018). In 2017, Xu et al. developed a method for producing diesel-like biofuel from docosanoic acid (Xu et al., 2017). Therefore, identifying cell cultures capable of VLCFA superproduction holds significant commercial potential.</p>
<p>During the analysis of the fatty acid composition of total lipids from suspension cell cultures from the All-Russian Collection of Cultured Plant Cells (Titova et al., 2021; Nosov et al., 2023; Nosov et al., 2024), we discovered that a suspension cell culture of <em>Polyscias filicifolia</em> L.H. Bailey (Araliaceae) accumulates VLCFA levels in total lipids significantly above the typical range. Since this phenomenon has not been previously described in the scientific literature, we aimed to study the peculiarities of the FA composition and metabolism during the cultivation of <em>P. filicifolia</em> cells in detail. The objective was to determine whether VLCFA biosynthesis is associated with specific culture growth stages and to identify the period of most intense synthesis.</p>
<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>
<p><strong>2.1. Plant Material</strong></p>
<p>This study investigated a suspension culture of <em>Polyscias filicifolia</em> (Ridl.) L.H. Bailey (line No. BFT-01-05) from the All-Russian Collection of Plant Cell Cultures at the Institute of Plant Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences. Additionally, an adventitious root culture of <em>P. filicifolia</em>, obtained from a leaf explant, was analyzed. Fresh leaf samples for the analysis of total lipid fatty acid composition were provided by the Greenhouse of the N.V. Tsitsin Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p><em>(Text to be added, e.g., regarding Nile red staining)</em></p>
<p><strong>2.4. Growth Curve Analysis of Suspension Cell Culture</strong></p>
<p>To determine the growth parameters, suspension cell cultures were grown in a series of flasks, with a minimum of three flasks (i.e., biological replicates) for each sampling day. Fresh weight (FW) was evaluated by separating the cells from the culture medium using Whatman No. 52 filter paper under vacuum, followed by weighing. To determine the dry weight (DW), the cell biomass was first weighed for FW and then dried at 50°C to a constant weight (for approximately 24 h).</p>
<p><strong>2.5. Comprehensive Analysis of Lipid Fatty Acid Composition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5.1. Fixation of Cell Biomass and Extraction of Total Lipids</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suspension culture cells intended for the analysis of total lipid fatty acid composition during cultivation were collected from flasks by filtration, as described in Section 2.4. The cells were transferred to 2 mL glass vials with 500 µL of ethanol and derivatized on the same day, as detailed in Section 2.5.2.1.</li>
<li>For storage and subsequent total lipid extraction, filtered suspension culture cells (approx. 5–8 g FW) were transferred to a 250 mL conical, flat-bottomed flask. To fix the cells, 50 mL of isopropanol containing 0.001% BHT was added, and the flask was heated at 75°C for 15 min. After cooling for 20 min, the flask was stored in a freezer at -18°C for a maximum of 60 days. The adventitious root culture biomass was fixed in a similar manner (Bengtsson et al., 2021).</li>
<li>To obtain a total lipid extract, the cells in isopropanol were transferred to 50 mL centrifuge tubes and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,300 × <em>g</em> for 5 min. The isopropanol supernatant was collected in a clean flask. A mixture of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v; 26.25 mL) was added to the cell pellet, and the tube was shaken for 15 min on a BioSan OS-20 orbital shaker at 250 rpm. Subsequently, 8.75 mL of chloroform was added, and the tube was shaken for another 15 min. Finally, 8.75 mL of water was added, the tube was vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 2,300 × <em>g</em> for 5 min. The upper phase was discarded, and the lower chloroform phase was carefully collected and combined with the isopropanol supernatant from the fixation step. The extraction procedure was repeated twice. The combined extract was dried over 5 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvents were removed using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The dried lipids were redissolved in a chloroform:methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL and stored in a glass vial at -18°C (Bligh and Dyer, 1959).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5.2. Analysis of Fatty Acid Composition of Total Lipids</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2.5.2.1. Preparation of Free Fatty Acids from Cells, Tissues, and Lipid Extracts</strong>
<ul>
<li>To determine the fatty acid composition and content, samples were prepared from either total lipids in suspension culture cells, plant tissues, or lipid extracts. Three weighed portions of fresh cells (approx. 150–200 mg FW) were taken from two randomly selected flasks for each time point. Thus, a total of six biological replicates were obtained for each growth point within a single passage. Leaf and root culture samples were homogenized in a mortar. For saponification, samples were placed in 2 mL glass vials, and 500 µL of 0.001% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in 96% (v/v) ethanol, 120 µL of 5 M aqueous KOH, and 100 µL of heptadecanoic acid in isopropanol (250 µg/mL) as an internal standard were added. Saponification was carried out for 60 min at 75°C in a solid-state thermostat. To remove unsaponifiable compounds, 600 µL of <em>n</em>-hexane was added to the vials, which were then vortexed, centrifuged at 2,300 × <em>g</em> for 3 min, and the upper phase was discarded. This washing step was repeated twice. Free fatty acids (FFAs) were then extracted by adding 150 µL of 20% (w/w) aqueous sulfuric acid, followed by two extractions with 600 µL of <em>n</em>-hexane. After each extraction, the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged (2,300 × <em>g</em>, 3 min). The upper hexane phases were combined in a separate vial, and the solvent was evaporated to dryness under a stream of argon (Nosov et al., 2024).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2.5.2.2. Preparation of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) from Free Fatty Acids</strong>
<ul>
<li>To obtain FAMEs, 200 µL of 1% (v/v) sulfuric acid in methanol was added to the vial containing dried FFAs (Section 2.5.2.1), and methylation was performed for 30 min at 55°C. After cooling, 100 µL of water and 300 µL of <em>n</em>-hexane were added. The mixture was vortexed, centrifuged at 2,300 × <em>g</em> for 3 min, and the upper phase was collected for GC-MS analysis. All procedures were performed in glass vials on the day of biomass collection. The same method was used for the transesterification of total lipid extracts obtained as described in Section 2.5.1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2.5.2.3. Preparation of FAMEs via Base-Catalyzed Transesterification with Trimethylsulfonium Hydroxide (TMSH)</strong>
<ul>
<li>To confirm that the unusual very-long-chain fatty acids were incorporated into glycerolipids rather than existing in free form, a transesterification reaction was performed on the lipid extract using TMSH, which does not react with free fatty acids. The experiment was conducted with a freshly prepared 0.2 M TMSH solution in methanol. To prepare the reagent, 4.4 g of trimethylsulfonium iodide was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol with gentle heating. Subsequently, 5 g of Ag₂O was added, and the mixture was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 4 h. The solution was then filtered and stored at 4°C for up to two months (Yamauchi et al., 1979).</li>
<li>For transesterification, 300 µL of the methanolic TMSH solution was added to 1–2 mg of lipid extract in a 2 mL vial. The vial was incubated for 30 min at 55°C in a solid-state thermostat (El-Hamdy and Christie, 1993). FAMEs were extracted with <em>n</em>-hexane after the addition of 150 µL of water, as described in Section 2.5.2.2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2.5.2.4. Concentration of Fatty Acids by Argentation TLC</strong>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate the identification of fatty acid isomers, including minor species, FAMEs were pre-concentrated according to their degree of unsaturation using argentation (silver) thin-layer chromatography (TLC), followed by conversion to DMOX derivatives for GC-MS analysis.</li>
<li>Silica gel 60 TLC plates (10 × 10 cm) were impregnated with a 5% aqueous silver nitrate solution for 30 min and activated by drying for 1 h at 110°C. Approximately 5 mg of FAMEs dissolved in <em>n</em>-hexane was applied to the starting line. The plate was developed in a chamber with a mobile phase of <em>n</em>-hexane:acetone (90:10, v/v). After development, the plate was air-dried and sprayed with a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein solution in methanol (80 mg/L). Silica gel zones containing FAMEs were visualized under UV light (365 nm). Fractions corresponding to mono-, di-, and triunsaturated FAMEs (Rƒ values of 0.64, 0.41, and 0.18, respectively) were scraped into clean vials, and the esters were extracted with 1 mL of an <em>n</em>-hexane:diethyl ether mixture (1:1, v/v) (Sidorov et al., 2024).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2.5.2.5. Preparation of Dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) Derivatives of Fatty Acids</strong>
<ul>
<li>The FAMEs obtained in Section 2.5.2.4 were converted into DMOX derivatives. First, FAMEs were saponified to FFAs using KOH as described in Section 2.5.2.1. The FFA solution (approx. 1 mg) was evaporated in an argon stream at 40°C. Then, 100 µL of oxalyl chloride was added, and the reaction was carried out for 1 h at 50°C. The solution was evaporated, and 500 µL of a 10% solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in methylene chloride was added. The reaction was performed for 1 h at 50°C. The mixture was then evaporated, and 500 µL of trifluoroacetic acid was added, followed by another 1 h incubation at 50°C. DMOX derivatives were extracted with <em>n</em>-hexane using a method similar to that for FAMEs and analyzed by GC-MS (Sidorov et al., 2024).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5.3. GC-MS Analysis of Fatty Acid Derivatives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FAMEs were separated by capillary gas chromatography (GC) on a Crystal <a href="http://5000.NP">5000.NP</a> system equipped with an AS-2M autosampler and a Chromatec Crystal MSD quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (Chromatec, Russia). A 60 m × 0.25 mm Restek Rtx-2330 capillary column with a 0.2 µm film thickness was used. The temperature program was as follows: initial temperature of 60°C held for 8 min, then ramped at 10°C/min to 175°C (held for 5 min), then at 6.5°C/min to 245°C (held for 25 min). The injector temperature was 260°C, with a split ratio of 20:1 and an injection volume of 1 µL. The ion source and quadrupole temperatures were 230°C and 150°C, respectively, with an ionization energy of 70 eV. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The mass range scanned was 50–550 <em>m/z</em>. Chromatograms were recorded using the total ion current. FAME peaks were identified by comparing their retention times and mass spectra with the NIST database using AMDIS software (Sidorov et al., 2024).</li>
<li>The unsaturation index (UI) of total lipids was calculated using the following formula (Gold et al., 2025):
UI = Σ(nᵢ × xᵢ) / 100
where nᵢ and xᵢ represent the number of double bonds and the molar percentage of the <em>i</em>-th FA, respectively.</li>
<li>For DMOX derivatives, the temperature program was: initial temperature of 140°C held for 8 min, ramped at 4°C/min to 210°C (held for 5 min), then at 3°C/min to 250°C (held for 25 min), and finally at 5°C/min to 240°C (held for 60 min). All other GC-MS parameters were identical to the FAME analysis. The mass range scanned was 110–550 <em>m/z</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5.4. Fractionation of Total Lipids into Polar Lipids, Diacylglycerols, and Triacylglycerols</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total polar glycerolipids, native 1,2-diacylglycerols (DAGs), and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were isolated by preparative TLC. Approximately 80 mg of the total lipid extract, dissolved in a chloroform:methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), was applied to the starting line of a 20 × 20 cm TLC plate (Silica gel 60, Supelco). Triolein and <em>rac</em>-1,2-DAG standards were applied alongside the extract. The plate was developed in a chromatographic chamber with a mobile phase of <em>n</em>-hexane:diethyl ether (75:25, v/v). After development, the plate was air-dried for 15 min, and lipid zones were visualized under UV light (365 nm) after spraying with a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein solution (80 mg/L in methanol). Zones corresponding to TAGs (Rƒ = 0.54–0.88) and native DAGs (Rƒ = 0.28–0.34) were scraped and extracted from the silica gel with an <em>n</em>-hexane:diethyl ether mixture (1:1, v/v). Polar lipids (Rƒ = 0.05–0.15) were extracted with a methanol:chloroform mixture (2:1, v/v). The fatty acid composition of the isolated lipid classes was determined after transesterification with 0.2 M TMSH in methanol, as described in Section 2.5.2.3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5.5. Positional Distribution Analysis of Fatty Acids in TAGs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The preparation of <em>sn</em>-2-monoacylglycerols (<em>sn</em>-2-MAGs) from TAGs was performed using porcine lipase. The reaction mixture was prepared by dissolving 15 mg of lipase in 3 mL of 0.25 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 µL of 0.01 M CaCl₂ and 250 µL of 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and the final volume was adjusted to 5 mL with Tris buffer. For deacylation, 535 µL of this enzyme solution was added to 1 mg of TAG in a 2 mL glass vial, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 µL of an <em>n</em>-hexane:diethyl ether mixture (1:1, v/v). The resulting <em>sn</em>-2-MAGs were isolated from the reaction products by TLC on 10 × 10 cm silica gel 60 plates using <em>n</em>-hexane:diethyl ether (1:1, v/v) as the mobile phase. The zone containing <em>sn</em>-2-MAGs (Rƒ = 0.15) was detected as described in Section 2.5.4. The fatty acid composition of the isolated <em>sn</em>-2-MAGs was determined after derivatization as described in Section 2.5.2.3.</li>
<li>The data were used to calculate the positional distribution of FAs in TAGs (Sidorov et al., 2014). The FA composition at the <em>sn</em>-1 and <em>sn</em>-3 positions was calculated using the following formula:
[A]₁,₃ = (3 × [A]₁,₂,₃ - [A]₂) / 2
where [A]₁,₃ is the molar percentage of the <em>i</em>-th FA at the <em>sn</em>-1,3 positions, [A]₁,₂,₃ is the molar percentage of the <em>i</em>-th FA in the intact TAGs, and [A]₂ is the molar percentage of the <em>i</em>-th FA in the <em>sn</em>-2-MAGs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.6. Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The study of fatty acid composition changes during the culture growth cycle involved two consecutive, independent passages. For each passage, 100 flasks were inoculated simultaneously and cultured for 30 days. At each sampling point, three flasks were randomly selected. Two wet cell samples were collected from each flask for FA analysis, resulting in six replicates per time point and a total of 72 GC-MS analyses per passage.</p>
<p>The normality of all quantitative data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk W-test. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (R) was used to evaluate potential relationships between the concentrations of individual fatty acids during the culture growth cycle.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica v.10 software (StatSoft, Inc., USA), and data were visualized using SigmaPlot software.</p>
